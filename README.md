React technical assignement

Technologies: React.js

Important notes:

● Use Redux for state management
● Use react-router
● UI needs to be fully responsive
● Other then the fact that the news posts on the landing page should be displayed in
cards, we have no more demands. It is up to you to show us your creativity and style
these components the way you want to.
● You are allowed to use a UI library of your own choosing.

Task: News portal

API: https://newsapi.org/

you will need to create a free api key at https://newsapi.org/account for developers

1. Landing page with search

Landing page should initially display news from the top headlines end-point.
Display 20 of those results in 'top-headlines cards' and the rest (if there are more) after 'load
more' button click at the bottom.
Each 'top headline card' should display title and description with an image if there is a url to the
image in the response. User can then click on a 'READ FULL ARTICLE' button to read the
article on a new page, 'Article'.


2. Article page
Article page should display:
Source, author, title, description, image, published at date and the content (if all of these have
been provided by the endpoint).

3. Search and sorting
User should be able to search for a term (everything endpoint).
Search results should be displayed in the same way as the top headlines - in cards and user
should also be able to read full article in articles page.
Once the user searches for the first term there should appear a 'sort by section' offering options
to sort results by popularity or relevance or published date (Top headlines should not have
sorting option).
User should be able to go back to home page displaying top headlines.
